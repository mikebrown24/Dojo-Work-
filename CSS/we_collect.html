            <p class="paragraph"> We donate 1 in 10 the machines to charities and worthy causes. This helps grow individuals who are in need of

            <h2> Welcome to We Collect Your IT </h2>
            <p> We offer a free collection service across the UK for the removal of your old IT systems. We safely reuse this
                equipment by ensuring any sensitive or personal information that was on these machines is either physically
                removed or destroyed before we reuse them. Using us shall not only benefit the environment by avoiding the
                waste and disposal of this equipment but shall also help others, as we donate and proportion of all the equipment
                we collect. </p>

        <div id="main_content3">
            <h2> Why waste? We will collect.... </h2>
            <p> The environmental and social benefits of reuse do not only help conserve natural resources, but help reduce air
                and water pollution caused by hazardous disposal. Reuse reduces the amount of greenhouse gas emissions caused
                by the manufacturing of new products. It simply makes good sense to let us collect and reuse your equipment.
