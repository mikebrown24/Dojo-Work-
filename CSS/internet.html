            <h3> Clients and Servers </h3>
            <p> Computers connected to the Web are called clients and servers. </p>
            <ul> 
                <li> Clients are the typical Web user's Internet-connected devices (for example, your computer
                    connected to your Wi-Fi, or your phone connected to your mobile network) and Web-accessing software
                    available on those devices (usually a web browser like Firefox or Chrome). </li>
                <li> Servers are computers that store webpages, sites, or apps. When a client device wants to access a 
                    webpage, a copy of the webpage is downloaded from the server onto the client machine to be displayed
                    in the user's web browser. </li>
            </ul>

            <h3> So What Actually Happens? </h3>
            <ol>
                <li> The browser goes into the DNS server and finds the real address of the server that the website
                    lives on. </li>
                <li> The browser sends an HTTP request message to the server asking it to send a copy of the website 
                    to the client. </li>
                <li> If the server approves the clients request, the server sends the client a "200 OK" message, 
                    which means "permission granted! Here you go!", and then starts sending the website's files
                    to the browser as a series of small chunks. </li>
                <li> The browser assembles the small chunks into a complete website and displays it for you! </li>
            </ol>

            <h3> The Big 3 - HTML, CSS, JavaScript </h3>
            <p> While the server can process information in many different languages, the files that they serve to
                the client are <i> always </i> going to be some combination of HTMl, CSS, and JavaScript! </p>
