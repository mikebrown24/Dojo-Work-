            <h2> Javascript Basics </h2>
            <p> <span class="first-word"> <u> Javascript </u> </span> a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. Javascript
                is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility
                for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. Javascript lives inside a host environment
                (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic
                control over them. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <span class="first-word"> <u> Variable Declaration </u> </span>  Javascript variables are containers for storing Data values - imagine a cup
                    you fill with coffee, the cup that holds the coffee,a variable holds a value. All javascript variables
                    must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span class="key-word"> var x; </span> </li>

                <li>
                    <span class="first-word"> <u> Variable Assignment </u> </span> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables- our cup can now
                    have coffee pourned in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = asignment operator assigns a value
                    to a variable. <span class="key-word"> var x = 10. </span> </li>

                <li>
                    <span class="first-word"> <u> Data Types </u> </span> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know
                    the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean- <span class="key-word"> true </span> or <span class="key-word"> false </span> ; <span class="key-word"> null </span>
                    aka nothing; Number - <span class="key-word"> 42 </span> or <span class="key-word"> 3.14159 </span> ; String- <span class="key-word"> "Coding Dojo Rocks!"; </span> Array- <span class="key-word"> [1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'] </span>; and
                    Object - <span class="key-word"> {first_name:'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'} </span> </li>

                <li>
                    <span class="first-word"> <u> Conditionals </u> </span> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions-
                    hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional
                    statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <span class="key-word"> if </span> a specified
                    condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span class="key-word"> else if </span> to specify a new condition to test, if the
                    first condition is false, <span class="key-word"> else </span> we execute this block of code; </li>

                <li>
                    <span class="first-word"> <u> Loops </u> </span> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially
                    do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well
                    you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop! </li>

                <li>
                    <span class="first-word"> <u> Function </u> </span> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run
                    that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together
                    a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table
                    top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a
                    ton more tables to do so lets call our functions over and over and over again. </li>
            </ul>
