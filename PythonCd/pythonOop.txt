-Objects have two very important features: Storage of 
information and ability to execute some logic.
-Objects store two different types of information: Attributes
and methods. Attributes are characteristics of an object, and 
methods are the things that object can do.
- The _init_ method is called every time a new object is created. 
-A class: Instructions for how to build many objects that share characteristics.
-An object: A data type built according to specifications provided by the class definition.
-An attribute: A value. Think of an attribute as a variable that is stored within an object.
-A method: A set of instructions. Methods are functions that are associated with an object. 
Any function included in the parent class definition can be called by an object of that class.
-Python's __init__ method is something that's known as a magic method. Magic methods are 
automatically created and sometimes invoked when a new instance of a class is created. One you'll 
be working with in most classes you build is __init__.
-__init__ is useful because it allows us to set some attributes when a new instance is created.
